# connector-google-spreadsheet

This module allows the importation of Google Spreadsheets into Odoo.

Important notes:
================
- The header row is mandatory, and use the same syntax as
  the native Odoo CSV importation tool.
- In order to upload importation errors into a Google Spreadsheet,
  you must title the *first* column of your Google sheet: "ERRORS".
- In order to determine the rows to import the program check the length
  of the first column of data. In other words if the first column of
  *data* (not the "ERRORS" column) is empty the program raise an error
  (no data to import)
- Empty columns (with even the header cell empty) are ignored.
- Unknown model's columns are also ignored.
- Chunk logic handle the one2many cases if the first column of data
  represent the relation (root entries not blank and child entries blank)
